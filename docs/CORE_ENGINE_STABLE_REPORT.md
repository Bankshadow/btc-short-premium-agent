# Core Engine STABLE Report — Slice 8 Regression

Branch: **`v2-core`**  
Date: **2026-06-06**  
Scope: Full v2 core engine regression after Slice 7 UI projection migration

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Slice 8 ran a full automated regression across MVP 1–24, Core Engine modules (validator, lifecycle FSM, projections, trace, health, guard chain), and Slice 7 UI projection migration. **All 218 unit/integration tests pass.** Production build succeeds.

**No P0 safety regressions found.** Live trading remains locked. Guard chains block unsafe execute/close. Secrets are not exposed in UI or API payloads tested.

**Recommendation (2026-06-06 post-Slice 8): `CORE_ENGINE_STABLE`**

**Incident (production): P1 — core pages stuck at `Loading…`** — See [PRODUCTION_LOADING_FIX_REPORT.md](./PRODUCTION_LOADING_FIX_REPORT.md). Root cause: full-page `LoadingOrError` gate + `useApi` effect cleanup leaving `loading=true` forever when fetch outlived unmount; no immediate zero-state render on client.

**Recommendation (after loading fix): `CORE_ENGINE_STABLE`**

Regression is green (239/239 tests), build passes. Production loading fix: `getDefault*()` projection defaults, API envelopes with `PROJECTION_FALLBACK`, `fetchWithTimeout` (4s), zero-state-first pages, `GET /api/core/boot-check`. **Requires Vercel redeploy of `v2-core` to take effect in production.** Remaining limitations: legacy API retention (adapter parity) and Reports briefing/audit sections — documented, non-blocking.

**Incident (production): P1 — `/core` partial stability** — See [CORE_ENGINE_PARTIAL_STABILITY_FIX.md](./CORE_ENGINE_PARTIAL_STABILITY_FIX.md). Root cause: ui-consistency and projection-parity rebuilt expensive projections (Binance, reports summary, enriched trades) on every request; stale OPEN trades counted against FLAT exchange positions; lifecycle warnings unaggregated.

**Recommendation (after Hotfix 2 — UI/projection sync): `CORE_ENGINE_PARTIAL`**

See [CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX2_UI_PROJECTION_SYNC.md](./CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX2_UI_PROJECTION_SYNC.md).

**Journal repair (2026-06-11):** See [CORE_ENGINE_JOURNAL_REPAIR.md](./CORE_ENGINE_JOURNAL_REPAIR.md). Repairs zero-fill reconciliation trades, backfills `CLOSE_REVIEWED`, runs post-trade loop. **Requires deploy + `POST /api/journal/repair` on production.**

**Hotfix 3 (2026-06-11):** See [CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX3_PROJECTION_MAPPING_STATUS.md](./CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX3_PROJECTION_MAPPING_STATUS.md). Dashboard bundle mapping, Binance status consistency, stale trade soft warning, PnL pending labels.

**Hotfix 4 (2026-06-06):** See [CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX4_UI_BINDING_EVIDENCE_STRICTNESS.md](./CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX4_UI_BINDING_EVIDENCE_STRICTNESS.md). Projection bundle unwrap, UI page binding, strict evidence validator, API-first core health.

**Hotfix 5 (2026-06-06):** See [CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX5_UI_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_STRICT.md](./CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX5_UI_SOURCE_EVIDENCE_STRICT.md). `getProjectionBundleForUI`, shared `ProjectionBundleProvider`, strict evidence with closed-trade projection checks, ui-consistency DOM note.

**Hotfix 6 (2026-06-06):** See [CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX6_DEBUG_SHAPE_UI_BINDING.md](./CORE_ENGINE_HOTFIX6_DEBUG_SHAPE_UI_BINDING.md). `GET /api/core/projections/debug-shape`, `normalizeProjectionBundle`, dashboard projection-source banner, Reports Binance from bundle, fixed `getDefaultTradeProjection` runtime crash.

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `/` dashboard renders (no permanent Loading) | ✅ Hotfix 1 + 2 |
| `/trades`, `/ai-status`, `/reports`, `/settings` render | ✅ Hotfix 2 — stable fallbacks + bundle-first |
| Dashboard uses real bundle values when API OK | ✅ Hotfix 6 — `normalizeProjectionBundle` + provider debug |
| Trades/Reports use bundle closed/evidence counts | ✅ Hotfix 6 — normalized bundle binding |
| Navigate between pages without zero reset | ✅ Hotfix 5 — `ProjectionBundleProvider` in AppShell |
| Binance status consistent when keys present | ✅ Hotfix 6 — bundle Binance on Reports + consistency rules |
| Stale trade manual repair (soft WARNING) | ✅ Hotfix 3 — `STALE_TRADE_MANUAL_REPAIR_REQUIRED` |
| Core page health matches `/api/core/health` | ✅ Hotfix 4/5 — `resolveCoreHealthStatus` |
| Evidence excludes PENDING_PNL / zero-fill trades | ✅ Hotfix 5 — strict validator + projection checks |
| ui-consistency documents no DOM checks | ✅ Hotfix 5 — `browserDomChecksAvailable: false` |
| Projection debug endpoint (no secrets) | ✅ Hotfix 6 — `/api/core/projections/debug-shape` |
| Dashboard shows REAL_BUNDLE vs FALLBACK | ✅ Hotfix 6 — diagnostic banner |
| Stale OPEN not counted as active open | ✅ reconciliation in projections |
| `npm run build` passes | ✅ verify after Hotfix 6 (330 tests) |
| Evidence 0/12 until real fills (8 rejected) | ✅ expected under strict rules |

**Recommendation (after Hotfix 6): `CORE_ENGINE_PARTIAL`**

Deploy Hotfix 6 and verify production: Dashboard banner `REAL_BUNDLE`, totalTrades=8, Reports Binance not `MISSING_ENV` when keys present. Assign **`CORE_ENGINE_STABLE`** only when all UI pages match bundle API and evidence strictness is confirmed in production.

Assign **`CORE_ENGINE_NOT_READY`** only if any core page remains permanently Loading.

## 11. Issues Fixed (Slice 8 + follow-up)

| Priority | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| P1 | `appendCoreEventStrict` not on execute/close hot paths | Wired in `execute-testnet-order.ts`, `execute-testnet-close.ts` |
| P1 | Strict append failed ORDER_EXECUTED (lifecycle link) | `validateLifecycleTransition` includes `decisionLogId`/`runId` in simulation |
| P2 | AI Status missing trace UI | Trace panel via `/api/core/trace/[tradeId]` |
| P3 | ESLint 5 errors | `use-api.tsx` async fetch; `isBlobJournalEnabled` rename |
| P3 | Missing API regression tests | `api-regression.test.ts` (12 tests) |
| P3 | Lifecycle test gap | ORDER_EXECUTED + linked review strict test |

---

## 12. Issues Remaining

| Priority | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| P3 (adapter) | Reports briefing/audit/replay still read legacy `/api/reports/summary` | Primary stats use projections; legacy sections labeled |
| P3 (adapter) | Legacy APIs retained (`/api/mission/snapshot`, `/api/trades`) | Parity period; not removed until CI gate |
| P3 | No `npm run typecheck` script | TypeScript covered by `npm run build` |

### Resolved P1 (production loading)

| Priority | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| P1 | Production core pages stuck at `Loading…` | Zero-state-first pages, `useApi` hard timeout, `projection-defaults.ts`, `getProjectionBundle()` partial fallbacks, `GET /api/core/boot-check` |

---

## 13. Known Limitations

1. Event Journal remains source of truth; projections are derived and may lag until cache bust on read paths.
2. Legacy APIs (`/api/mission/snapshot`, `/api/trades`, `/api/reports/summary`) retained for adapter parity period.
3. Dashboard supplemental context (`/api/core/ui/context`) is server-derived but not a registered projection type.
4. ESLint errors do not block build or tests.
5. Vercel Blob journal persistence depends on `BLOB_STORE_ID` / OIDC env (production fix from prior slice).

---

## 14. Recommendation

### **`CORE_ENGINE_STABLE`**

**Rationale:** 239/239 tests pass, build passes, production loading fix ready (zero-state-first UI, `getDefault*()` defaults, boot-check), no P0 safety issues, UI reads projections for critical state, execute/close hot paths use strict core append, trace UI wired, guard chains active.

**Post-STABLE roadmap (non-blocking):**
1. Automated projection vs legacy parity CI gate
2. Deprecate legacy snapshot/trades APIs for UI
3. Migrate Reports briefing/audit to projection-only reads

---

## Manual Verification Checklist (optional)

- [ ] `node scripts/checklist-verify.mjs` against production URL
- [ ] Load `/`, `/trades`, `/ai-status`, `/reports`, `/settings`, `/operator` — confirm no infinite loading
- [ ] `GET /api/core/ui-consistency` → `status: "OK"`
